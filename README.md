# Angular Cookbook AI Assistant ü§ñüìö

Welcome to the **Angular Cookbook AI Assistant**! This project transforms static content from the *[Angular Cookbook](https://ng-cookbook.com)* into an interactive, AI-powered Q&A tool. Readers can now ask questions about Angular topics directly on the website and receive tailored answers, including links to relevant demo projects and GitHub source code. Built with **Google Gemini**, **LLamaIndex**, and **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**, this assistant provides a new level of engagement for Angular enthusiasts.

## Features üöÄ
- **Ask Away**: Users can query Angular topics from the book, like Signals, Unit Testing, and Performance Optimization, and get instant answers.
- **Resource Links**: For topics covered in the book, the assistant provides direct links to demo projects and GitHub repositories.
- **Fallback to Gemini**: If a question is outside the book's scope, the AI assistant taps into Google Gemini‚Äôs vast knowledge to respond.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Step 1: Start the Backend
- Follow instructions in the [Backend README](./backend/README.md) to launch the Python-based backend with Google Gemini and LLamaIndex integration.

### Step 2: Run the Frontend
- Once the backend is running, start the Angular-based frontend by following the instructions in the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md).

After starting both the backend and frontend, open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and experience the AI assistant in action!
